When possible, please use the same indent style as the rest of the code. Also, be sure to "sign" yourself, by putting your name under the @author tag for any methods you make. If you're adding to an existing method or class, put a comma after the first author and then put your name. If you don't "sign" yourself, someone might sign their self and take credit! Additionly, please only use Java 6. I will not accept any pull requests that use Java 7/8 features.

If a pull request meets that criteria, I'll probably accept it :) I'm not going to leave you hanging like some other repository owners do, I'll either merge it or not merge it when possible. 

Recommended IDE: eclipse. If you use another IDE, please don't include any of it's auto-generated files in your pull request :P The .gitignore should handle most of the major IDEs (IntelJ, Netbeans, etc), but if I forgot anything feel free to add it.
