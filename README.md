Graveyard-Library
=================

Graveyard is a multipurpose java library with all types of things you might like. It's licensed under the MIT license, so you can do (almost) whatever you want, use it for a game, a helpful program, you can print out all the source code and dance on it (which would be lots of fun I bet). If you are to do anything cool with it, please let xbony2 know, he's rather interested in these things.

Note: Ask @xbony2 on twitter if you need help understanding anything. 

Contributers: please use the same indent style as I do when possible. Also, ALWAYS sign your work, or I'll have to do for you. Be sure to use java 6 as well, do not use java 7 or java 8 features (in fact, java 8 in considered unsupported because it breaks some of the java 6/7 code).

Authors: iBit Tech (<- mostly just xbony2) and contributers.
