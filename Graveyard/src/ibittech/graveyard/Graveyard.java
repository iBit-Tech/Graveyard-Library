 * <b>Graveyard</b> is a multipurpose java library with many things you might like.
 * It's licensed under the MIT license, so you can do (almost) whatever you want, use 
 * it for a game, a helpful program, you can print out all the source code and 
 * dance on it (which would be lots of fun I bet). If you are to do anything cool with it,
 * please let xbony2 know, he's rather interested in these things.
 * 
 * Note: Ask @xbony2 on twitter if you need help understanding anything. 
 * 
 * Contributers: please use the same indent style as I do when possible. Also, 
 * <b>ALWAYS</b> sign your work, or I'll have to do for you. Be sure to use java 6 as
 * well, do not use java 7 or java 8 features.

	 * Graveyard's current version.
	 * 
	 * Version system:
	 * A change from 1.0.0a to 1.0.0b means I've fixed a small bug that I've probably just
	 * found a minute after a release, most often just a one-liner.
	 * A change from 1.0.0b to 1.0.1a means I've fixed a moderate bug or added/changed a
	 * small feature.
	 * A change from 1.0.1a to 1.0.6a means I've fixed an annoying bug or added/changed a
	 * feature or two (or a few).
	 * A change from 1.0.6a to 1.1.0a means I've added dozens of new features or changed
	 * dozens of features slightly.
	 * A change from 1.1.0a to 2.0.0a means I've added tons of stuff, removed tons of stuff
	 * and basically rewritten large parts of the code. After version 1.9.Xx, 2.0.0a will
	 * be next. Note you may have to rewrite parts of your code if you rely on this library.
